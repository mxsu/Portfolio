        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          Our solution was to create a device that the elderly could use at home
          without assistance of a trained professional. We designed a device
          using Arduino sensors for user input, and then a user interface
          designed in Processing to provide feedback and record daily progress.

      <div class="process-flex">
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          The process of getting to this idea was during a brainstorming session
          where one of the members mentioned their mother suffered from
          arthritis. After looking at various devices that help with fine motor
          skills on YouTube, we decided to combine these devices as their
          purpose of improving the patients functions were similar.

        <h2>Sketching</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          After evaluating the most common fine motor skill exercises we decides
          on three mechanisms: a pin drop to test user finger accuracy, a
          squeeze ball for grip strength, and twisting a knob to judge wrist
          flexibility.

          device and the computer, and how it would record their daily exercise.

          I created diagrams and coded the sensors to test the wiring and

          prototype. For the Squeezing mechanism, pin drop, and twisting knobs.

        <h2>Final Model Progress</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          After consideration from the TA and classmates, we realized we had too
          many unnecessary designs in our implementation. For our revision we
          decided to simplify it from a 3 sided design into a 1 sided design.
          Our problem was that we had too many knobs, pins, and separate LED
          strips in our design. We simplified it to use 1 LED strip for all 3
          functions and have a single rotary encoder with different sized knobs.
          <br />Some other improvements we made to our iterations was the use of
          coloured foamboard to aid the use of visual feedback, copper tape
          instead of aluminum foil for durability, sound effects for auditory
          feedback

        <h2>Final Coding Progress</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          We also implemented a Processing user interface that could give visual
          cues on the amount of progress in an exercise and track daily
          progress.

        <h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          I learned a lot from this project since it was both a digital and
          physical project, I think one of the biggest problems I had was that
          it was very annoying working with three different sensors at the same
          time on Arduino and then sending the client data into the Processing
          server. Initially we had different roles and I did Arduino coding,
          while my group member Grace did Processing code, we were really good
          at communicating with each other, but as we had to do more debugging,
          more problems rose up. Another big problem I had was with wiring
          because everything was behind a cramped tight box. What I would do
          different is maybe consider doing one sensor at a time and then
          implementing it into Processing instead of doing all three sensors at
          once. Another thing I would do differently is have longer wire
          connection so I could do the wiring outside without disconnecting some
          interior wiring.
