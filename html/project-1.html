            Design a microsite targeted towards parents planning to take their
            kids on a summer trip to Playland. Their main pain points and
            concerns are unknown dangers of the amusement park, getting
            lost/losing their kids, ride information and safety, spending
            budget, and weather concerns.

          Parental needs and concerns are addressed by the one-stop-shop
          information provided on our microsite, which is aided by simplistic
          yet visually appealing design. Content is arranged by order of
          importance and icons are used to create visual support.

        <h2>Creating a User Persona</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          We created a user persona to target a user group and address their
          main worries, in our case it was a parent planning to bring their kids
          on a summer trip to Playland.

        <h2>Moodboards</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          We created mood boards to find an art direction for our website, as
          our group were split between two different styles: a more Gradient &
          Dreamy approach where it was more colorful, softer geometric shapes
          paired with sharp shapes to break motion, and a more fluid design to
          provide users a sense of excitement and motion in an amusement park.
        </p>

        />
        <p class="p-container float-right">
          The other direction was a Simplistic & Modern style where we had flat
          colors, sharp geometric shapes, big icons, and clear grid designs.
          Which helped provide our target user with ease of navigation to easily
          find information to plan trips.

        <h2>Ideation: Sketching Layouts</h2>
        <p class="p-container float-right">
          As a team, we each sketched out our ideas for for the website layout
          before deciding on elements for our website.

        <h2>Wireframing</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          Our desktop wireframes were created based on a 6-grid layout and had
          the necessary information condensed into one page.
          <br /><br />
          A problem we faced was that the mobile design was a lot harder to
          layout as it was not as wide as a webpage. It created a design where
          it was tightly packed together without much negative space in between
          causing users to feel anxious.

        <h2>Testing + Iteration</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          After testing and feedback from our classmates and TA, we found out a
          problem with both our website and mobile design were too condensed,
          without a lot of negative space. Our redesign took that feedback and
          implemented a website with more negative space, asymmetrical balance,
          and use of icons, graphics and textures to balance out the negatives
          and guide viewers eyes towards the next section.

        <h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          After using Webflow to create our website and mobile designs, we ran
          into a lot of problems with the application. The biggest problem is
          that only one person can edit at a time, and that really brought down
          the productivity of the team as one person held a lot of the burden.
          We solved this problem by sharing the account and fixing things on our
          own time, but the website was not as flushed out as we had hoped
          because of time constraints and the learning curve of the software.
          Another problem was that changing something on the mobile side also
          changed the webpage side. This was a huge problem because we wanted to
          have floating and resizable icons on the webpage, but the grid layout
          of the icons are in different positions on the mobile page.
