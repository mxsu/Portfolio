          Our team decided to create a journal entry app with a text, photo,
          mood, and gallery activity pages. Storing data entry information with

        <h2>Ideation: Sketching Layouts</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          As a team, we each sketched out some quick layout ideas for our
          project. We wanted to have a way to browse the gallery for images
          while also being able to read text.

        <h2>Testing + Iteration</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          In our first iteration, after testing and feedback from our Professor
          and TA, we found out that it was hard to balance out images with text
          in a mobile screen since their display size is small. We solved this
          by changing the text size to be responsive and creating a limit on the
          number of characters, which is where we got the name JotDown as we
          wanted users to quickly take a picture and jot down their thoughts.

      <div class="process-flex">
        <h2>Iteration</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          In another iteration, we decided that images were too small for
          viewing and wanted users to view images and text in a more expanded
          view, and thus we created a popup view when users touch the gallery
          card. We also wanted users to have privacy since journals could
          sometimes contain personal or private information.

        <h2>Biggest Challenge</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          The biggest challenge I faced was inserting images into the SQL, I
          completed the camera and gallery image entry pretty early, but I had
          trouble sending the image to shared preferences and the SQL. First we
          tried to convert the image from URI to bitmap to a byte array and then
          save it to the SQL, but we figured out it was easier to save the image
          to a file path or grab the file path and then save it as a string into
          the SQL. Even after completing the saving file path to SQL, we had
          trouble with displaying the image in our gallery card view because we
          had a problem with accessing read permissions in our app. We had
          enabled the camera permission, but we did not have the file storage
          permission enabled. We didn't know that reading from the file storage
          was different from reading from the camera storage, which meant that
          the app could display camera photos but not the photos from the phone
          gallery.

        <h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          One of the challenging things we have learned from this project was
          how to work on offline projects together as with code it is hard to
          work collaboratively in real time. We designated different features to
          work on and then at the end of the week we combined the project
          together creating an app that flowed together. From that we also
          learned how to comment and explain code to each other as we built our
          app because as the program got more complex the more messy the code
          got. At the end of the project, we acquired great teamwork skills,
          managing how to split work, and learned how to explain and integrate
          our ideas.
