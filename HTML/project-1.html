        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          For this school project, our team designed a music recital hall
          pavilion for the City of Surrey's Holland park.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          I was the lead designer of the team, in charge of the sketching, model
          rendering, and environment design.
        </p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p class="p-container">Jan 2022 - Apr 2022</p>

        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          Yilin Luo, Michael Su, Qijie Wang, Xiaotong Zhang
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          Sketching, 3D Modelling, Spatial Design, Environmental Design,
          Physical Model building.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p class="p-container">Rhinoceros3D, Grasshopper3D, Twinmotion, Wix</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          Apply a set of architectural syntactic rules to generate a spatial
          design for either a sculpture, ceremony, or music recital pavilion to
          be located in the City of Surrey's Holland Park. Design a structure
          using principles and elements of design to create an aesthetically
          pleasing, functional, and satisfying human experience. Apply a variety
          of representations including sketching, digital and physical modeling
          to communicate design intent and solution to the client.
        </p>

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <img src="../images/park-location.webp" />
        <h2>Location exploration</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          we chose a location between 2 walkways, with no shade from trees, and
          a quiet environment for our music recital pavilion. This allowed us to
          have a decent amount of foot traffic, with a resting area for
          pedestrians. Music could be played clearly away from noises such as
          traffic, playgrounds, and construction. For our architectural design,
          we chose to use a symmetrical hexagonal shape to provide a centric
          design for sound.
        </p>

        <h2>Ideation and Planning</h2>
        <img src="../images/geo.webp" />
        <p class="p-container">
          I designed and completed this two dimensional design exercise using
          geometric shapes cut in fabric to compose possible forms for the
          pavilion.
        </p>
        <h2>Sketching and Revisions</h2>
        <img src="../images/sketch1.webp" />
        <p class="p-container">
          I drew our first isometric sketch based on the geometric shapes. After
          learning about new design principles in class, we reiterated our idea
          and incorporated infill and panel architecture into our updated
          sketches.
        </p>

          After learning about new design principles in class, we reiterated our
          idea and incorporated infill and panel architecture into our updated
          sketches.
        </p>
        <h2>Model Render and Environmental Design</h2>
        <img src="../images/render-final.webp" />
        <img src="../images/render-top.webp" />
        <p class="p-container">
          based on our isometric sketches, we created a digital version of our
          pavilion model in Rhinoceros3D. After getting feedback from the TA and
          classmates, we changed the windows to an Elementary wall architecture.
          I imported the model of our pavilion into the software Twinmotion,
          recreated the park in the software using its assets, and then added
          people to showcase our design on the human experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Model</h2>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../images/pergola1_edited.webp" />
          <img src="../images/pergola2_edited.webp" />
          <img src="../images/pergola3_edited.webp" />
        </div>
        <p class="p-container">
          for the physical model, we had to recreate the pergola section of the
          structure. I created a 3D design for the laser cutter.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/error.webp" />
        <h2>Biggest Challenge</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          In Figure 13, one big pain point was the crashing of software causing
          loss of progress, fortunately our group had only lost about 25-30 mins
          of work, while some others had lost 2 hours. I solved this by saving
          frequently and turning on auto save.
        </p>
        <h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          Things I learned was that digital models are a lot easier to create
          and redesign compared to a physical model, but it comes with a steep
          learning curve of a new software. It doesn't need materials such as
          glue, textures, and parts can be resized or changed. Interior design
          is easier as we can walk through or hide walls to visualize a space.
