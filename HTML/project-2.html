        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          For this school project, our team designed a webpage for Playland
          targeted towards parents of kids and their common worries during a
          family trip at an amusement park.
        </p>

          organizing roles, and utilization of collaboration tools.

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          Design a microsite targeted towards parents planning to take their
          kids on a summer trip to Playland. Their main concerns are unknown
          dangers of the amusement park, getting lost/losing their kids, ride
          information and safety, spending budget, and weather concerns.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          Parental needs and concerns are addressed by the one-stop-shop
          information provided on our microsite, which is aided by simplistic
          yet visually appealing design. Content is arranged by order of
          importance and icons are used to create visual support.
        </p>

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <img src="../images/park-location.webp" />
        <h2>Location exploration</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          We created a user persona to target a user group and address their
          main worries, in our case it was a parent planning to bring their kids
          on a summer trip to Playland.
        </p>

        <h2>Moodboards</h2>
        <img src="../images/geo.webp" />
        <p class="p-container">
          We created mood boards to find an art direction for our website, as
          our group were split between two different styles: Simplistic & Modern
          style where we had flat colors, sharp geometric shapes, big icons, and
          clear grid designs.
        </p>
        <p class="p-container">
          The other direction was a more Gradient & Dreamy approach where it was
          more colorful, softer geometric shapes paired with sharp shapes to
          break motion, and a more fluid design.
        </p>

        <h2>Sketching</h2>
        <img src="../images/sketch1.webp" />
        <p class="p-container">
          As a team, we each sketched out our ideas for for the website layout
          before deciding on elements for our website.
        </p>

        <h2>Wireframing</h2>
        <img src="../images/sketch1.webp" />
        <p class="p-container">
          Our desktop wireframes were created based on a 6-grid layout and had
          the necessary information condensed into one page.
        </p>

        <p class="p-container">
          A problem we faced was that the mobile design was a lot harder to
          layout as it was not as wide as a webpage.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing + Iteration</h2>
        <img src="../images/render-final.webp" />
        <img src="../images/render-top.webp" />
        <p class="p-container">
          After testing and feedback from our classmates and TA, we found out a
          problem with both our website and mobile design were too condensed,
          without a lot of negative space. Our redesign took that feedback and
          implemented a website with more negative space, asymmetrical balance,
          and use of icons, graphics and textures to balance out the negatives
          and guide viewers eyes towards the next section.

        <img src="../images/error.webp" />
        <h2>Biggest Challenge</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          In Figure 13, one big pain point was the crashing of software causing
          loss of progress, fortunately our group had only lost about 25-30 mins
          of work, while some others had lost 2 hours. I solved this by saving
          frequently and turning on auto save.
        </p>
        <h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
        <p class="p-container">
          After using Webflow to create our website and mobile designs, we ran
          into a lot of problems with the application. The biggest problem is
          that only one person can edit at a time, and that really brought down
          the productivity of the team as one person held a lot of the burden.
          We solved this problem by sharing the account and fixing things on our
          own time, but the website was not as flushed out as we had hoped
          because of time constraints and the learning curve of the software.
          Another problem was that changing something on the mobile side also
          changed the webpage side. This was a huge problem because we wanted to
          have floating and resizable icons on the webpage, but the grid layout
          of the icons are in different positions on the mobile page.
